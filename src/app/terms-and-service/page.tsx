                The Coupon must be redeemed exclusively within the time

              made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days
              from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User's decision

          Under EU law, for a minimum period of 2 years after delivery, traders

              ONLINE DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR CONSUMERS
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The European Commission has established an online platform for
              alternative dispute resolutions that facilitates an out-of-court
              method for solving any dispute related to and stemming from online
              sale and service contracts. As a result, any European Consumer can
              use such platform for resolving any dispute stemming from
              contracts which have been entered into online. The platform is
              available at the following link.
